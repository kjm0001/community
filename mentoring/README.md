# Kubernetes Upstream Mentoring Programs

This folder will be used for all mentoring initiatives for contributing to
Kubernetes. Check out KubeCon and other CNCF events and programs for end user
training and learning.

---

We understand that everyone has different learning styles and we want to support
 as many of those as possible. Mentoring is vital to the growth of an individual
  and organization of every kind. For Kubernetes, the larger the project becomes
  , it's necessary to keep a continuous pipeline of quality contributors and we want you to hang around!
