# Group Mentoring for Contributor Ladder Growth
*This is a work in progress*


## Summary
This is an experimental group mentoring program where individuals will work
self-paced in a semi-structured learning environment over the course of three
months. Want to get `/lgtm` rights? Be a decision maker in an OWNERS file? This
could be a great way to get the knowledge you need, and some accountability to
do it. Through this program you will get the opportunity to interact with active
contributors who may be on the same path as you as well very experienced
Kubernetes contributors.

## How This Works
Foundation:  
This program is built around our [community membership guidelines].
This doc shows how you can grow through the project in different roles and
provides the requirements to get to each level on our ladder. Building trust is
the key to this document.

## Cohorts
Contributors will form small cohorts of no more than 10 (8-10 is great) all aiming
to achieve the same goal - the next stage on the contributor ladder - with the
help of active contributors (1 mentor to 3 mentees). For example, our first test
cohort was Member -> Reviewer in SIG Apps, SIG Cluster Lifecycle, and SIG AWS.  

Each cohort will last 2-3 months based on the time requirement in the community
membership guidelines per level. This time requirement is pretty flexible and not
a hard line because as noted above, this is about building trust and skills. Folks
want to know you are dependable and understand the domain.

The cohort gathers on slack in a private room that one of the mentors or sig-contribex
will PR into the slack config files on the k/community repo.
TODO: make the self service aspect here solid for faster onboarding

Mentors can rotate facilitating once a week for slack standups with the expectation
that cohort members need to check in with a predetermined status update
(accomplishments, challenges, etc)  

## Benefits of a Cohort
* Peer mentoring  
* Clear goals, objectives, and timelines  
* Each mentee is working toward the same goal, cohort has an end date/timeframe  
* Exposure to multiple areas of the project making well-rounded contributors  
* Mentors share time commitments and responsibilities  
* Exposure to multiple mentors in an open and collaborative environment

## First Cohort Success Rates
5/10 graduated into OWNERs files from members to reviewers.   
TODO check how many are still active  

## FAQs
I'm a SIG Chair/TL/Subproject Owner and have a need for more members, reviewers,
approvers, how can we form a cohort?  
TODO  

I'm a contributor looking for a cohort, where do I go?  
TODO  

I'm not a chair, tech lead, or subproject owner but I'm a reviewer or approver,
how can I help?  
TODO

## Open ended questions
how can mentors organize the tasks, issues, prs, that they give to the mentees?   
should they be high priority items to help with backlog and mentor at the same time?  
should we include a list of topics that should be covered by role?  
- example: for member to reviewer we focused on - live how to code review, how to review [better] docs, communicating with empathy, advanced testing/ci, general community/governance
