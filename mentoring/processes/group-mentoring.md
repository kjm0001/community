group-mentoring.md may have some other process info baked into the program info.

## Logistics
1. SIG/WG determines need
2. Consults with sig-contribex; contribex sets up infra (slack channel; TODO build this out)
3. Posts a note to their mailing list and k-dev that they are looking for more
reviewers/approvers/x_role and would like to form a group to mentor who are
already in the role below it. (example: already a member and they need more
  reviewers)
4. Sets a start date and end date; schedule a kick off meeting so everyone can
meet
over video/audio (1 and only unless the group establishes other comms). Also set
the weekly slack standup days so they are consistent.
5. Program begins
6. If the mentors think certain skills will need to be taught/learned, they
should be done upfront. (We scattered them for the first cohort and there were
  things that would be been more valuable to learn in the beginning of the
  journey)  
6. Feedback is continuous*
7. Mentors start PRs for those who graduated  

*Feedback is continuous but will have a half way check in point. The goal is that
mentees should not be surprised by the outcome of the program.
